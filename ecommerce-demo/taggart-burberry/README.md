## React Router

#### `npm install react-router-dom`

**BrowserRouter** HTML5 history API, keep UI in sync with URL

**Route** Renders some UI when path matches current URL
props:

- match
- history
- location

**Switch** Exclusively renders a route, so similar paths wont also be rendered, rendering occurs in the same spot so transitions work well with Switch.

**withRouter** Higher Order Component where you can access the history object's properties in a Component that does not have a Route

```javascript
export default withRouter(ComponentName); // returns the history props to the passed in component
```

**history**

- location.path
- push
- goBack
- etc

### reselect

`<redux_store>.selectors.js`

#### input selectors

- grab or select a slice of state
